There was an anomalous increase in booking mismatches between 17 May to 31 May. 
This was due to backend issues leading to the loss of precision in stored address coordinates. 
This issue has been resolved. Since 31 May, the daily mismatch rate has been reduced to 
an average of approximately 10% a day (which is close to the approximately 9.07% daily mismatch rate 
before the backend issues occured)

Furthermore, for the mismatches after 31 May, the distances between the requested waypoints and the 
offered waypoints are mostly within a reasonable threshold of less than 40m, with a mean of 29.4m. This is
comparable to the distances between requested waypoints and offered waypoints for matches.
